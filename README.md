### [ShorterURL]

**Description**: A test project demonstrating a minimal API for URL shortening using .NET 8 and Entity Framework. This API features:

- **URL Shortening**: Create short URLs with optional custom codes and expiration dates.
- **Redirection**: Redirect users from short URLs to the original URLs.
- **Details Retrieval**: View details of shortened URLs, including click counts and expiration dates.
- **Deletion**: Remove shortened URLs from the system.

Additionally, it includes functionalities like generating QR codes for short URLs and tracking click counts, all using an in-memory database for simplicity. This project serves as a minimal example of API development with .NET and is designed for testing and demonstration purposes.
